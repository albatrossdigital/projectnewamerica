Installation instructions
=========================

Download the Stripe PHP library from https://github.com/stripe/stripe-php and copy it into sites/all/modules
so that the file sites/all/libraries/stripe/lib/Stripe.php exists.  We use the libraries module, so you can also
place the library in sites/sitename.com/libraries.

Install the module as normal at Admin -> Modules.
